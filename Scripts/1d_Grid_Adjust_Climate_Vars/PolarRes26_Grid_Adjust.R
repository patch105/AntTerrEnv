# PolarRes26 -- STEP 3: REPROJECT, RESAMPLE, AND MASK EVERY CLIMATOLOGY OUTPUT
# ==============================================================================
# Takes every .tif Script 2 wrote (for every model) and produces masked
# versions of each, on a common grid:
#   - <name>_COASTLINE.tif       -- masked to the coastline domain
#   - <name>_ICEFREE.tif         -- masked to the (historical/mid) ice-free domain
#   - <name>_ICEFREE_FUTURE.tif  -- masked to the future ice-free domain
#                                    (FUTURE-period files only, saved as a
#                                    separate, additional output)
#
# SEA ICE is a special case (see sections 5b-5f below): instead of the
# generic COASTLINE/ICEFREE/ICEFREE_FUTURE masks, every monthly sea-ice
# climatology file gets four other products, produced on the same
# reprojected/resampled grid, using the SAME ice-free-land inputs as every
# other variable:
#   - <name>_CONCENTRATION.tif        -- coast/SG masked, cropped to 60 deg S
#   - <name>_BUFFER_<radius>.tif      -- mean concentration within each buffer
#                                        distance of every ice-free-land cell
#   - <name>_DIST_TO_OPEN_WATER.tif   -- distance (km) from the centre of every
#                                        ice-free-land cell to the nearest
#                                        open-water cell, i.e. the sea-ice
#                                        edge (SIC < sea_ice_edge_thresh, 15%)
#   - <name>_DIST_TO_SEA_ICE.tif      -- distance (km) from the centre of every
#                                        ice-free-land cell to the nearest
#                                        sea-ice cell (SIC >= 15%)
#
# Each sea-ice product is checked for existence independently (when
# SKIP_EXISTING is TRUE), so adding a new product does not force the
# (expensive) buffer products to be recomputed for files that already have them.
#
# For RACMO sea-ice files specifically, an extra landmask fix runs first
# (section 5b): RACMO sea-ice output sits on a rotated-pole grid that comes
# out of Script 1/2 without a usable CRS, and the RACMO landmask
# (ANT11_masks.nc) is offset from it in index space. A fixed template sic
# file (always the same one, regardless of which RACMO job is running) is
# used to recover the rotated-pole CRS and the index-space offset against
# the landmask; that CRS + landmask are then applied to THIS job's actual
# raster before it's reprojected. HCLIM and MetUM sea ice (and every other
# RACMO variable) are untouched by this and go through the normal
# CRS-handling in section 5a.
#
# Sea-ice files also get a non-interactive coastal gap-fill after
# reprojection (section 5d): small NA gaps left by bilinear reprojection
# near the coastline are patched via patch-labelling + focal mean, with a
# fixed size_thresh of 100 cells for every model -- no histogram
# inspection, no manual tuning. Patches touching the raster edge are never
# filled, regardless of size, since those are out-of-domain rather than
# local artifacts.
#
# ---- Job table source (section 2) -----------------------------------------------
# By default (USE_MANIFEST <- TRUE) the job table is built from
# pending_manifest.csv, written by list_pending_jobs.R, rather than by
# rescanning every .tif under input_base. This means job_index 1..N here
# lines up 1:1 with the pending jobs that script reported -- you don't
# re-walk the full ~3000+ file tree, and you don't re-check SKIP_EXISTING
# against files list_pending_jobs.R already confirmed are missing.
# Set USE_MANIFEST <- FALSE to fall back to the original full-directory
# scan (e.g. if you haven't run list_pending_jobs.R, or want to force a
# full rebuild/audit run). SKIP_EXISTING (section 4b) still applies either
# way, as a safety net against a stale manifest.
#
# NOTE: list_pending_jobs.R must know about the two new sea-ice outputs
# (_DIST_TO_OPEN_WATER.tif and _DIST_TO_SEA_ICE.tif). Until it does, its
# manifest will not list sea-ice files that only lack these products --
# run with USE_MANIFEST <- FALSE for the catch-up run.
#
# One job = one input file, selected via a single job_index (same pattern as
# Script 2) -- run with no argument (or an out-of-range one) to print the
# full table of every file that will be processed, and how many jobs that is.
